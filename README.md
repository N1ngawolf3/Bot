Rep for deployment telegram bot on heroku

I wrote this bot for me and my groupmates. The reason is my fatigue.
During the quarantine every my groupmate every few hours asked me for some files so 
i wrote bot to drop them files automatically from cloud(yandex disk) for easier 
access from many platforms including phones. 

After few days of research and running this bot on my own pc I decided to
deploy it on heroku. Because it is free and allows me not to "kill" my pc. 
This repo is linked to heroku.

It is my first useful and rather big project.
